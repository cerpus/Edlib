# Hub setup

## Setting an app key

`APP_KEY` must be set to a secret, unguessable value. The value must be 32
random bytes, encoded as base64, and prefixed with `base64:`. You can generate
such a value with:

```bash
echo "base64:$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
```

The configuration should look like:

```text title=".env"
APP_KEY=base64:long-base64-encoded-string-here
```

:::danger
Failing to set this could result in a total compromise of your Edlib instance.
:::

## Creating an admin account

In `sourcecode/hub`, or the `hub` Docker container:

```sh
php artisan edlib:create-admin-user your@email.example
```

## Configuration settings

### `FEATURE_SOCIAL_USERS_ARE_VERIFIED`

If enabled, users logging in from "social login providers" (i.e. Facebook) will
automatically have their email addresses verified upon next login, without
having to go through the email verification process.

:::caution
Only enable this if you trust a login provider completely.
