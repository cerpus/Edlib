# H5P configuration

These are environment variables in Content Author that can be configured to change the behaviour of H5Ps and the editor.

## H5P_OVERRIDE_DISABLE_SETTING
Show or hide the footer when displaying the H5P. The footer contains buttons for 'Embed', 'Reuse', 'Rights of use'
and link to h5p.org. The display of the individual buttons may depend on other settings.
```text title=.env
H5P_OVERRIDE_DISABLE_SETTING=false
```
```text title="Allowed values"
true  => Footer is not displayed
false => Footer is displayed
```

## H5P_DEFAULT_EXPORT_OPTION
Show or hide the 'Reuse' button in the footer. The reuse button enables download of the content, including the
libraries it uses, as an `.h5p` file. For details on the `.h5p` file type see the
[specification on h5p.org](https://h5p.org/documentation/developers/h5p-specification).
```text title=.env
H5P_DEFAULT_EXPORT_OPTION=2
```
```text title="Allowed values"
0 => Reuse button is hidden
1 => Controlled by author, default is display
2 => Controlled by author, default is hide
3 => Reuse button is displayed
4 => Controlled by permissions. Currently, permission is always denied, i.e. the button is hidden.
```

## H5P_SHOW_DISPLAY_OPTIONS
Show the 'Display options' section in the editor. The section allows the author to set the visibility of the footer,
and visibility of the 'Rights of use' and 'Reuse' buttons in the footer.
```text title=.env
H5P_SHOW_DISPLAY_OPTIONS=false
```
```text title="Allowed values"
true  => Show section in the editor
false => Section is not displayed
```

## H5P_DEFAULT_SHARE_SETTING
Set the default value of the sharing option in the editor. Regardless of this setting the author can toggle the
setting on or off. For more about sharing see the [Shared content](../support/userGuides/shared-content)
section in the User Guides.
```text title=.env
H5P_DEFAULT_SHARE_SETTING=private
```
```text title="Allowed values"
private => Sharing is default disabled
share   => Sharing is default enabled
```
