## Hosting with Docker Compose

:::warning

The `docker-compose.yml` file in the Edlib repository is for development **only**, and not suitable for hosting a public
Edlib instance.

:::

A template of a Docker Compose setup suitable for production is available at
<https://github.com/cerpus/edlib-docker-example>. This setup automates some of the first-time setup to make it easy to
get started.

It is recommended to have some experience with Docker Compose before using this.

## Traditional PHP hosting

Edlib is comprised of two [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) services, and can run anywhere Laravel applications run. Note
that the services have different for PHP versions.

For most purposes, [the Laravel documentation on deployment](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/deployment) applies to Edlib.
