# Standards and usage in Content Author

## The different locale code standards used

### [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1)
A two-letter code that represents a language. Examples are `en` for English and `nn` for Norwegian Nynorsk.

### [ISO 639-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-2)
Same languages as ISO 639-1 using a three-letter code. Also contains codes that don't represent a language, but are
collective language codes. Examples are `eng` for English, `nno` for Norwegian Nynorsk and the collective `smi`
for Sami languages.

### [ISO 639-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-3)
Three-letter code with a more comprehensive coverage than ISO 639-2, collective language codes are excluded.
Examples are `eng` for English, `nno` for Norwegian Nynorsk. The `smi` code is removed as it's a collective code.

### [ISO 15897](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_15897)
A combination of language and country codes. Exampples are `en_GB` for UK English, and `nn_NO` for Norwegian nynorsk.

### [IETF BCP47](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag)
Most common format is a combination of language and country, but ISO 639-1 and some ISO 629-2 codes are valid.
Examples are `en-gb` for UK English, `nn-no` and `nn` for Norwegian Nynorsk, and `sma` for Southern Sámi. Tool to check
if a code is valid https://r12a.github.io/app-subtags/.



## Who uses what standard

### React-Intl
Most front-end code is in React, like the Content Browser, CA Editor and the Question content type. React-Intl uses
Javascript [Intl](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl) that accepts
several different codes like ISO 639-1, ISO 639-2 and IETF BCP47. For Norwegian Nynorsk, `nn`, `nn-no` and `nno`
are all valid.

### Laravel
On the server side CA uses the Laravel framework. The Larvel
[documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/localization) show the use of two-letter codes in their examples these are
probably ISO 639-1 codes. For languages that differ by territory the
[recommendation](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/localization#using-short-keys) is to use ISO 15897. This is mainly
due to the `Pluralizer`, see [PR in Laravel Documentation](https://github.com/laravel/docs/pull/5605).
[Languages](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/localization#pluralization-language) that Laravel supports for pluralization.

### HTML
The [global `lang` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/lang) uses IETF BCP47 format.

### LTI
[Documentation](https://www.imsglobal.org/specs/ltiv1p1p1/implementation-guide) specifies IETF BCP47 value
for `launch_presentation_locale`.

### CA Editor
In the editor there is a dropdown where the user can select the language of the content, this is used by the Content
Browser, aka the Hub, in the content list and also when filtering on language. This uses ISO 639-3 format.

### H5P
According to the [documentation](https://h5p.org/documentation/for-developers/translate-h5p-libraries#nameTranslation)
ISO 639-1 codes are used as the filename of the translation files. There are some use of IETF BCP47 codes (like `es-mx` for
Mexican Spanish) and also ISO 639-2 (`sme` for Northen Sámi).
