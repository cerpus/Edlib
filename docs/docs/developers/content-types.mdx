# Content Types

Edlib can be extended with additional content types. Content types in Edlib are provided by standard LTI tools. If it
supports LTI 1.0/1.1/1.2 and Deep Linking 1.0, it will work with Edlib. Content Author, the bundled content type
provider, is one such tool.

Edlib extends LTI to add functionality that wasn't anticipated by the authors of the LTI spec, but will also work with
strictly compliant LTI tools.

If you are not familiar with LTI, you should review the following specifications:

* [LTI 1.1 implementation guide](https://www.imsglobal.org/specs/ltiv1p1/implementation-guide)
* [LTI Deep Linking specification 1.0](https://www.imsglobal.org/specs/lticiv1p0/specification) (known previously as
  Content-Item Message)

## Editing content

Editing isn't a feature described by the LTI Deep Linking (LTI-DL) specification. Edlib gets around this by optionally
sending an LTI-DL request to the item URL, instead of the standard endpoint for content selection. For tools that don't
support this, content selected via the default endpoint just replaces the previously selected content.

## Extended LTI parameters sent to the Hub by the LTI platform

* `ext_edlib3_return_exact_version=1`

  Make the 'Use Content' button in item selections return a link to the current version of a resource.

* `ext_edlib3_include_owner_info`

  If enabled, and the LTI Platform has setting `The platform authorizes edit access` enabled, the e-mail address of
  the content owner will be included in the response. Set to `"1"` to enable, not enabled by default.

* `ext_edlib3_copy_before_save`

  For edit requests. Instructs Edlib to create a copy of the content and save the changes to the copy.
  Set to `"1"` to enable, not enabled by default.

## Extended LTI parameters sent to LTI tools by the Hub

* `ext_edlib3_embed_code`

  The HTML code for letting the tool know how to embed the content. This will be an `<iframe>` element.
  
* `ext_edlib3_embed_resize_code`

  The HTML code for including a script to resize the embedded content. This will be a `<script>` element.

* `ext_edlib3_published`

  Sent by the hub when creating or editing content. When editing, will be `1` if published, or `0` otherwise. When
  creating, will be the desired default value of the published flag.

* `ext_edlib3_shared`

  Sent by the hub when creating or editing content. When editing, will be `1` if the content is shared, or `0`
  otherwise. When creating, will be the desired default value of the shared flag.

## Resizing

Content can request that the Hub resize its iframe height. To do this, the content should send a message like so:

```javascript
window.parent.postMessage({
    action: 'resize',
    scrollHeight: 640,
}, '*');
```

## LTI Deep-Linking 1.0 extensions

The following attributes can be used with items of the `LtiLinkItem` type to communicate extra information that isn't
part of the LTI Deep-Linking spec:

    * `@id`: `https://spec.edlib.com/lti/vocab#languageIso639_3`
    * `@type`: `http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#normalizedString`

* `published`
    * `@id`: `https://spec.edlib.com/lti/vocab#published`
    * `@type`: `http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#boolean`

* `shared`
    * `@id`: `https://spec.edlib.com/lti/vocab#shared`
