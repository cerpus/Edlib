# Version API migration

To migrate an old install of Edlib that uses the Version API:

* Check out [28a423a](https://github.com/cerpus/Edlib/commit/28a423a734975e6374c9d92d08c124251e109601),
  which is the last version to contain the migration script. Do not upgrade
  past this version until the migration is completed.

* Run:

  ```shell
  php artisan edlib:migrate-version-api
  ```

* The Version API data is now migrated to Content Author, and you may upgrade to newer version of Edlib.
