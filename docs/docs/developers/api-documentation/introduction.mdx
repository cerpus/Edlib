# Introduction

Edlib is in the process of reorganizing and moving parts of the code between APIs. We are improving logic and keeping the code more accessible and tidy. Your gain as a developer is more logic, fewer APIs, and a better overview. 
As we move forward, our services, APIs and proxies will be combined and an in-depth developer-specific documentation will be added.


### Current APIs
- auth
- common
- contentauthor
- lti
- resources
- version
