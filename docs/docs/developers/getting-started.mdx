# Getting started

The goal of this guide is to get you up and running with a **development** environment for Edlib.

We are still working on documentation for setting up Edlib on-premise and in the cloud. Be sure to check back later if you are interested in this or [contact us](mailto:support@edlib.com) directly if you need any help or have any questions. You can also visit the [discussions section on GitHub](https://github.com/cerpus/Edlib/discussions) to se what other users have asked for or start your own discussion thread.

## Prerequisites

- A recent version of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) with Docker Compose.
- The [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) command-line utility
- Ports 80, 443, 3306, 5432, and 6379 on the host machine must be unoccupied.

:::note

1. Edlib requires HTTPS in development.
2. Check the error log if there are problems with services not starting. Some services just execute a task at launch and
   then exit with code 0; this is normal.

:::

:::danger

The Docker Compose setup exists only for development purposes. Deployments of this setup to the public internet may pose a security risk.

## Install

1. Clone the Edlib directory and navigate there

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cerpus/Edlib.git
   cd Edlib
   ```

2. Start Edlib via Docker Compose

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   This step might take a while. You can check the status of services with

   ```bash
   docker compose ps
   ```

3. Update your hosts files to point Edlib's services to 127.0.0.1. On Linux and
   macOS, you can update your hosts file with `scripts/update-host-file.sh`:

   ```bash
   sudo scripts/update-host-file.sh
   ```

   On Windows, you will have to update the file manually with the values found
   in the script.

4. Install the root certificate generated in `data/nginx/ca/cacert.pem` on your
   system. The exact procedure will vary depending on your operating system.

## What's next?

To access the Edlib 3 hub, navigate to: https://hub.edlib.test/

You can create an admin user account by running:

```bash
docker compose exec hub php artisan edlib:create-admin-user <email>
```

To enable Content Author, you must add it as an LTI tool from the admin portal. View [this page](../hosting/ca-setup.mdx#adding-content-author-to-the-hub) for more info:
* LTI version: `1.1`
* Launch URL: `https://ca.edlib.test/lti-content/create`
* Consumer key: `h5p`
* Consumer secret: `secret2`

To use Edlib with Moodle, you must create an *LTI platform* from the Edlib 3
admin portal, then create an *external tool* in Moodle using the provided key
and secret. The item selection URL is: `https://hub.edlib.test/lti/dl`.
