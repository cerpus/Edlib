# Translating Edlib

Edlib's user interface is multilingual. Support for new languages can be added without extensive technical knowledge. This document will lead you through the process of translating Edlib's user interface to your language via Weblate. 
[Follow this link to find an overview of all translatable Edlib-projects on our Weblate site.][1].

## Translating the Hub 

The Hub is the core of Edlib, enabling users to search and filter for content made by themselves and others. In addition, it offers a detailed display of the content. The language files reside in [The hub](https://weblate.edlib.com/projects/hub/). 

## Translating LTI-tools 

### Content Author 

Content Author is the LTI tool for H5P authoring in Edlib. Its language files reside in [Content Author](https://weblate.edlib.com/projects/content-author/). By choosing "Language" in the menu, you'll get an overview of the different translations and the percentage they've been translated.



## Submitting New Translations

There are two ways to submit translations using Weblate.

1. [Register an account][2] and submit the translations more or less directly to the translation files. Make sure you start out on Edlib's Weblate site. Otherwise, you'll be creating the account outside of our project. When the account has been created and verified, contact us using support@edlib.com, and we'll grant your user access to translate.

:::note
If you don't receive the email to verify your account in a few minutes, check your spam folder. If after 15 minutes you still cannot find it in either your inbox or spam folder, you can [contact us][3]
:::

2. Making anonymous suggestions. Note that these translations need to be verified and added by us in order to be taken in as part of the translation files, and you will not be attributed. We prefer you go with option A, as we cannot verify all translations in different languages and we'd really like to honour our contributors. 

### What if my language is missing? 
If you want to translate Edlib to a language not listed in the project, please [contact us][3]. We can then set up the translation files needed for your language.
