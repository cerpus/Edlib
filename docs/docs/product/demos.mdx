## Gamilab &mdash; Game-based Learning

[Gamilab](https://gamilab.com/) is an online platform where you can find and create easy, fun and educational games. Gamilab uses game elements to motivate and engage players to learn faster and better, and to be more involved in their learning. By using elements like points, stars, highscores and badges we make learning feel like a game and motivate the player to learn while playing.

By the way, if you want to create your own Gamilab game to share with your students, then take a look at the [Gamilab Support page](https://support.gamilab.com/hc/en-us/articles/4420217786641-Create-a-new-game).

With Edlib, Gamilab can use [H5P-based content](https://h5p.org/content-types-and-applications) for in-game exercises. For example, in the game above, different H5P-based content types are used, including [Multiple Choice](https://h5p.org/multichoice), [Fill in the Blanks](https://h5p.org/fill-in-the-blanks) and [Find the Hotspot](https://h5p.org/image-hotspot-question).
