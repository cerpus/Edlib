# Open Source

Since the birth of Edlib back in 2015, we've worked steadily on developing the product and trying to make the right decisions. In 2021, we decided to do the right thing and turn it into an open-source project.

:::info

The Edlib open-source project can be visited on GitHub by following [this link.](https://github.com/cerpus/Edlib)

:::

Since then, we've added and removed lots of code and tried to document it both here and on GitHub. We currently support contributions via GitHub and Weblate for translations. See the separate section about [how to contribute](https://docs.edlib.com/docs/developers/contributing/).

## How we work

Our primary focus derives from our roadmap and the genuine wish to develop the best application for creating and managing learning resources.  
We pick our tasks, one by one, closing in on the continuously moving target, while sticking to the plan. Everyone has a say, and we welcome any input from the community outside our organization.
