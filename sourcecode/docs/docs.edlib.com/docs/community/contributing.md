# Contributing

Cerpus welcomes contributions to our [open source projects on Github](https://github.com/cerpus/Edlib). When contributing, please follow the [Cerpus Community Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Issues

Feel free to submit [issues and enhancement](https://github.com/cerpus/Edlib/issues) requests.

## Contributing

Please refer to each project's style and contribution guidelines for submitting patches and additions. In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

 1. **Fork** the repo on GitHub
 2. **Clone** the project to your own machine
 3. **Commit** changes to your own branch
 4. **Push** your work back up to your fork
 5. Submit a **Pull request** so that we can review your changes

NOTE: Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!

### Git Commit Messages

To speed up the review process and to keep the logs tidy, we recommend the following simple rules on how to write good commit messages:

#### Summary Line

- It should contain less than 50 characters. It is best to make it short.
- Introduce what has changed, using imperatives: *fix*, *add*, *modify*, and so forth.

#### Description

- Add extra explanation if you feel it will help others to understand the summary content.
- If you want, use bullet points (each bullet beginning with a hyphen or an asterisk).
- Avoid writing in one line. Use line breaks so the reader does not have to scroll horizontally.

:::tip
To ease review, try to limit your commits to a single, self-contained issue. This will also help others to understand and manage them in the future.
