# Translation files in Content Author

## Introduction
This contains a in-depth description on how translation works in Content Author (CA). If you are unfamiliar with the
different locale code standards and which part of CA that uses which, there is an overview on
the [Standards and usage](./standards) page.


### Content Author

Translations are handled by Laravel and the translation files contains a PHP array with short keys.  
New translations should be added using ISO 639-1 codes or, if the language differ by territory, IETF BCP47 code.


### Content Author Editor / React

[React-Intl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-intl) is used for handling translation. The translation files are in
JSON format and are loaded from JavaScript. 
New translations should be added using ISO 639-1 codes or, if the language differ by territory, IETF BCP47 code.


### H5P Core

H5P Core is used when creating, editing and viewing H5P content. It does not have any translations of its own,
they are provided by Edlib through Edlibs implementation of the translation function in the `H5PFrameworkInterface`.
The implementation uses Laravels translation functionality. The translations are also available in the `l10n` attribute
in the `H5PIntegration` JavaScript variable. The translation strings are in the `H5P.php` file in the language folders.


### H5P Editor

Used when creating or editing H5P Content. When creating new content there is a screen where the user can selet
which content type to use, translations for this screen is from H5P Editor. After selecting content type, the editor
is loaded. Translations here are from several different sources:

 1. __H5P Core__  
See the [H5P Core](#h5p-core) section above for info.

 2. __H5P Editor__  
Javascript file containing translations is loaded together with other required H5P Editor and Core JavaScript files.
Translations are handled by H5P.

 3. __H5P Content type__  
The translations for the selected content type, and content types/libraries it uses, are loaded by H5P Editor by sending
a request to Edlib. Edlib has a copy of the translations stored in the database, and uses this as a source for the
response. The translations files are loaded into the database when the content type is installed.
Translations are handled by the author of the content type.

 4. __Content Author__  
The sidebar to the right of the H5P editor is React. See the [Content Author Editor / React](#content-author-editor--react)
section above.


### Viewing H5P content

Translations are both from H5P Core and from the stored content. The [H5P Core translations](#h5p-core) are used
for e.g. the buttons "Reuse", "Rights of use" and "Embed" displayed below of the content.  
Translations stored with the content depend on the selected content type, and can be edited in the H5P Editor in
the "Text overrides and translations" section. The content is set in the `content` attribute in the `H5PIntegration`
JavaScript variable.
