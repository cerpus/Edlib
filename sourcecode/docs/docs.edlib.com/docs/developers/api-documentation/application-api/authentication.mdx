# Authentication

## Generate keys

In order to make requests against this API you must create an application and token in the admin interface of edlib.

You find the interface under settings > External applications.

If you don't have an external application you can create one by clicking "Create new" and giving it a name.
You can now click on your application in the list to create a token. You can now press "Create new" and a new token will
be generated for you.

A green field will appear and you can now copy the token. You will not have the possibility to get it later so take good
care of it. Above the "Create new" button you can also see the application id which you will also need to authenticate.

## Make authenticated requests

In order to make application requests you must set the following headers:
1. `x-api-key` This is where you use the token.
2. `x-api-client-id` This is where you use the application ID

You are now all set to make requests to the API.
