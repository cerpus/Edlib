# Getting started

The goal of this guide is to get you up and running with a **development** environment for Edlib.

We are still working on documentation for setting up Edlib on-premise and in the cloud. Be sure to check back later if you are interested in this or [contact us](mailto:support@edlib.com) directly if you need any help or have any questions. You can also visit the [discussions section on GitHub](https://github.com/cerpus/Edlib/discussions) to se what other users have asked for or start your own discussion thread. 

## Prerequisites

- A recent version of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Make sure you're on the latest (non distro-provided) version of `docker-compose`. 
- The [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) command-line utility
- Ports 80, 443, 3306, 5432, 5672, 6379, 9200, and 15672 on the host machine must be unoccupied

:::note

1. Edlib is a complex web application with the need of mulitple ports and HTTPS.
2. Check the error log if there are problems with services not starting. 
3. Note that the following services will have the status `Exited (0)` after their run:
- certs
- common-startup
- elasticsearch_password

:::

## Install

1. Clone the Edlib directory and navigate there

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cerpus/Edlib.git
   cd Edlib
   ```

2. Copy `localSetup/.env.example` to `localSetup/.env`

   ```bash
   cp localSetup/.env.example localSetup/.env
   ```

3. Start Edlib via Docker Compose

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   This step might take a while. You can check the status of services with

   ```bash
   docker compose ps
   ```

4. Update your hosts files to point Edlib's services to 127.0.0.1. On Linux,
   you can update your hosts file with `scripts/update-host-file.sh`. On
   Windows, you will have to update the file manually with the values found in
   the script.

   ```bash
   scripts/update-host-file.sh
   ```

5. Install the root certificate generated in `data/nginx/ca/cacert.pem` on your
   system. The exact procedure will vary depending on your operating system.
