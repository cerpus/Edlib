# Getting started

The goal of this guide is to get you up and running with a **development** environment for Edlib.

We are still working on documentation for setting up Edlib on-premise and in the cloud. Be sure to check back later if you are interested in this.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and docker-compose
- Ports 80, 443, 3306, 5432, 5672, 6379, 9200, and 15672 on the host machine must be unoccupied

## Install

1. Clone the Edlib directory and navigate there

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/cerpus/Edlib.git
   cd Edlib
   ```

2. Copy `localSetup/.env.example` to `localSetup/.env`

   ```sh
   cp localSetup/.env.example localSetup/.env
   ```

3. Start Edlib via Docker Compose

   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This step might take a while. You can check the status of services with

   ```sh
   docker-compose ps
   ```

4. Update your hosts files to point Edlib's services to 127.0.0.1. On Linux,
   you can update your hosts file with `scripts/update-host-file.sh`. On
   Windows, you will have to update the file manually with the values found in
   the script.

   ```sh
   scripts/update-host-file.sh
   ```

5. Install the root certificate generated in `data/nginx/ca/cacert.pem` on your
   system. The exact procedure will vary depending on your operating system.

## What's next?

* **To access the user-facing side of Edlib:**

  https://npm.components.edlib.local/

* **To access the admin interface:**

  https://api.edlib.local/admin

Documentation describing how to get quickly up and running with Edlib is currently being worked on.
