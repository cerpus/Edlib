# Architecture

## API types

The API consists of 3 different type of applications:

1. Proxy API
2. Internal API
3. Hybrid API

### Proxy API

**Location**: `sourcecode/proxies/*`

They are API's that can be accessed from the internet under a sub path (for example `/resources`).
They can only communicate to Internal API's and Hybrid API's.

### Internal API

**Location**: `sourcecode/apis/*` (except `contentauthor` and `common`)

Internal API's can only be accessed by other API's in Edlib. Internal API's cannot make requests to proxy API's

### Hybrid API

**Location**: `sourcecode/apis/contentauthor` and `sourcecode/apis/common`

Hybrid API's can be accessed by both other API's and from the internet. The internal part is protected with a key
shared to all API's inside Edlib. Hybrid API's cannot make requests to proxy API's.
