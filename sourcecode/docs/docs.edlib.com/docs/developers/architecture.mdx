# Architecture

## API Types

The API consists of 3 different application types:

1. Proxy API
2. Internal API
3. Hybrid API

### Proxy API

**Location**: `sourcecode/proxies/*`

APIs that can be accessed from the internet under a sub path (for example `/resources`). They can only communicate to Internal APIs and Hybrid APIs.

### Internal API

**Location**: `sourcecode/apis/*` (except `contentauthor` and `common`)

Internal APIs can only be accessed by other APIs in Edlib. Internal APIs cannot make requests to proxy APIs

### Hybrid API

**Location**: `sourcecode/apis/contentauthor` and `sourcecode/apis/common`

Hybrid APIs can be accessed by both other APIs and from the internet. The internal part is protected with a key
shared with all Edlib-specific APIs. Hybrid APIs, in turn, cannot make requests to proxy APIs.
