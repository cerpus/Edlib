# Bulk calculation of max score

When adding max score functionality to an H5P library, there can be existing H5Ps that will not
have max score set. Since every time an H5P is saved the max score value is calculated, one can simply edit
the H5P and max score will be updated for that H5P.

If you want to perform a bulk update or just check the number of H5Ps without max score, you can do that in
the Edlib Admin. After logging in to Edlib Admin, select `Content Author` in the left menu and then `Max score` under
`H5P` in the top menu.
A list of libraries that have an H5P without a max score set is shown, a count is displayed to the right.
Select libraries you want to calculate for, and click the `Start` button. A progress bar is displayed below
the library name.
