# H5P

## Requirements
1. Naming: naming is essential for maintaining compatibility with existing content. The name must be unique in order to avoid conflict with existing H5P packages.
2. Format: new H5P libraries must be uploaded as a zipped ```.h5p``` package.
3. Versioning: versioning must follow the standards of [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

:::caution
When developing new packages, make sure your PHP setup doesn't ignore warnings. In Edlib, all PHP warnings will be thrown.
