# Translating Edlib

Edlib's user interface is multilingual. Support for new languages can be added
without extensive technical knowledge. This document will lead you through the
process of translating Edlib's user interface to your language.

## Before you begin

You will need a text editor suitable for working with code. [Notepad++][1] and
[Visual Studio Code][2] are good choices. If you aren't sure, please use one of
these, as an unsuitable editor could mangle the language files in non-obvious
ways.

Download [Edlib's source code][3] to your computer and open its folder.

## Translating Content Author

Content Author is a prominent component inside Edlib. Its language files reside
in the `sourcecode/apis/contentauthor/resources/lang` directory. They are
grouped by locale, e.g. `en-gb` for British English. You should copy the
directory corresponding to the language you wish to translate from, and name it
according to your locale. (Don't worry about getting this wrong--it is a small
order to rename it.)

Now you can start translating. Open each .php file in the text editor, and you
should see something like this:

```php
<?php

return [
    'dialog.cancel' => 'Are you sure you want to cancel?',
];
```

Here, `dialog.cancel` on the left is the _key_, and `Are you sure you want to cancel?` on the right is the _value_. In reality there can be dozens of
key/value pairs in a translation file, separated by commas. The goal is to
translate all the right-hand values, in every file, while leaving the left-hand
keys untouched. As an example, when the above is translated to Norwegian, it
looks like this:

```php
<?php

return [
    'dialog.cancel' => 'Er du sikker på at du vil avbryte?',
];
```

## Translating Edlib Components

There are a few other translation files in `sourcecode/npm/components/src/i18n`.
The same principles apply here, albeit the naming conventions and file formats
are different.

Before:

```json
{
  "dialog.cancel": "Are you sure you want to cancel?"
}
```

After:

```json
{
  "dialog.cancel": "Er du sikker på at du vil avbryte?"
}
```

## Submitting new translations

If you are familiar with the workflows of Git and GitHub, you may submit your
translation by opening a pull request. Otherwise, please [contact us][4] so we
can help you.
