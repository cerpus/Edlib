# Installing Edlib - Linux

The easiest way to install Edlib locally is to use Linux.

1. First you will need to clone Edlib: `git clone git@github.com:cerpus/Edlib.git`
2. Go to the base directory of Edlib: `cd Edlib`
3. When setting up Edlib for the first time run: `./scripts/first-time-setup.sh`. This script will install all of the necessary dependencies and setup the repos.
4. You can now start Edlib with docker-compose: `docker-compose up -d`
5. Configure the browser to approve Edlib's local certificate authority. The certificate is located at `data/nginx/ca/cacert.pem`
6. You can now access Edlib at: `https://npm.components.edlib.local/?path=/story/edlibmodal--edlib-modal`
