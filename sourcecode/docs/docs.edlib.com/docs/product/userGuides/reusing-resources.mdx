# Reusing Existing Resources

Creating good educational resources is potentially a complex and time-consuming process. Hence, being able to reuse existing content is an important part of managing educational content. In that respect, not only does Edlib make it possible to reuse your own content, it also provides you with access to &mdash;appropriately [Creative-Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) licensed&mdash; shared content; that is, content that has been created and subsequently shared by other Edlib users with the wider Edlib community.
