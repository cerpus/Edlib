# Reusing Existing Resources

Creating good educational resources is potentially a complex and time-consuming process. Hence, being able to reuse existing content is an important part of managing educational content. In that respect, not only does Edlib make it possible to reuse your own content, it also provides you with access to &mdash;appropriately [Creative-Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) licensed&mdash; shared content; that is, content that has been created and subsequently shared by other Edlib users with the wider Edlib community.

<div class="text--center">
    <img class="edlib-image" alt="The 'My Content' tab in Edlib listing all of the resources that you have created" src="/img/reuse-resource-1.png" />
    <br/>
    <em>The 'My Content' tab in Edlib listing all of the resources that you have created</em>
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

In the "My Content" tab your last edited resource will appear at the top of the list. You can change the ordering of the list by choosing the "Most used" item from the drop-down menu located just above the listing on the right-hand side. What's more, resources can also be filtered by [H5P content type](https://h5p.org/content-types-and-applications) and ([Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/)) license type. Finally, it is also possible to search for resources by providing a search string.

<div class="text--center">
    <img class="edlib-image" alt="Filtering Edlib resource by H5P content type: 'Interactive Video'" src="/img/reuse-resource-2.png" />
    <br/>
    <em>Filtering Edlib resource by H5P content type: 'Interactive Video'</em>
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

As mentioned, resources can be filtered by H5P content type. In the example above we are filtering by the H5P interactive video content type.

<div class="text--center">
    <img class="edlib-image" alt="Searching for Edlib resources: 'Biology'" src="/img/reuse-resource-3.png" />
    <br/>
    <em>Searching for Edlib resources: 'Biology'</em>
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

Searching in Edlib is incremental: the resources are filtered on-the-fly as you type your search string. 

<div class="text--center">
    <img class="edlib-image" alt="Selecting a resource for the purpose of reuse (the 'Insert' option)" src="/img/reuse-resource-5.png" />
    <br/>
    <em>Selecting a resource for the purpose of reuse (the 'Insert' option)</em>
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

Once you have found a resource for the purpose of reuse you can either insert the resource into your learning content creation tool, edit the resource or &mdash;if you are the "owner" of the resource&mdash; delete it.

Editing a resource results in a new copy of the resource with Edlib's versioning system tracking the new copy on a separate version branch. From that point onwards, each resource can thereafter be modified separately and in parallel so that the resources become different.
