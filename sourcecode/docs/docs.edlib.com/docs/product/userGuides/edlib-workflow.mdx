# The Edlib Workflow

Edlib is a platform for creating, sharing, storing and reusing interactive learning resources. Saying that, Edlib is not a stand-alone application. Edlib is always used together with other learning applications like [Gamilab](https://gamilab.com), [Edstep](https://edstep.com) or LMSs like [Moodle](https://moodle.org/).

Managing your actual learning resources on one hand and making them available to learners on the other hand is what is being referred to with the "Edlib workflow". Let's take a step-by-step look at the workflow.

The screenshot below shows Edstep's course editor, specifically the content editor (consisting of modules which in turn consist of [H5P](https://h5p.org)s &mdash; interactive learning activities). In the case of Edstep, the jump-off point to Edlib is the "Add Step" button.

Clicking the "Add Step" button displays the accompanying dialog which allows you to provide the step's title and instructions. However, more importantly it also allows you to add Edlib content by means of the "Add Edlib Content" button.

<div class="text--center">

    <br/>

</div>

Clicking the "Add Edlib Content" button opens Edlib.

<div class="text--center">
    <img class="edlib-image" alt="Edlib's 'My Content' tab showing you a list of all your Edlib content" src="/img/edlib-workflow-3-1.png" />
    <br/>
    <em>Edlib's 'My Content' tab showing you a list of all your Edlib content</em>
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

Edlib's user interface is, broadly speaking, divided into three separate areas:
- My Content: This area (or tab) displays a list of all of the Edlib content that you have created together with the content that you are collaborating on with other people. 
- Shared Content: This tab displays all of the Edlib content that has been created and subsequently shared by other people and is available for re-use by the broader Edlib community. All content shared in this manner has an accompanying [Creative-Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/about/cclicenses/) which ...
- Editors for H5P-based content: Pending...

The re-use of existing Edlib content is straightforward: find and select the appropriate content resource and either edit it or insert it directly into the accompanying course or game.

<div class="text--center">
    <img class="edlib-image" alt="Pre-viewing existing Edlib content" src="/img/edlib-workflow-3-2.png" />
    <br/>
    <em>Pre-viewing existing Edlib content</em>
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

If existing content &mdash;either yours or content that has been shared by other users with the wider Edlib community&mdash; is unsuitable, then your next course of action would be to create a new learning resource.

<div class="text--center">
    <img class="edlib-image" alt="H5P content type selector" src="/img/edlib-workflow-5.png" />
    <br/>
    <em>H5P content type selector</em>
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

As an example of creating an H5P-based learning resource, you can see in the screenshot below the H5P authoring environment for [H5P interactive videos](https://h5p.org/interactive-video) &mdash; an HTML5-based interactive video content type allowing users to add multiple choice and fill in the blank questions, pop-up text and other types of interactions to their videos using only a web browser.
