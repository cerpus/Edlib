# The Edlib Workflow

Edlib is a platform for creating, sharing, storing and reusing [H5P](https://h5p.org)-based interactive learning resources. Saying that, Edlib is not a stand-alone application. Edlib is always used together with other learning applications like [Gamilab](https://gamilab.com), [Edstep](https://edstep.com) or an LMS like [Moodle](https://moodle.org/).

Take a look over at H5P.org to see a full list of H5P content types, the majority of which are supported by Edlib: [H5P Examples and Downloads](https://h5p.org/content-types-and-applications).

Managing your actual learning resources and subsequently making them available to learners is what is being referred to with the "Edlib workflow". Let's take a step-by-step look at the workflow.

The screenshot below shows Edstep's course editor, specifically the content editor (consisting of modules which in turn consist of H5Ps &mdash; interactive learning activities). In the case of Edstep, the jump-off point to Edlib is the "Add Step" button.

<div class="text--center">

    <br/>

    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

Clicking the "Add Step" button displays the accompanying dialog which allows you to provide the step's title and instructions. However, more importantly it also allows you to add Edlib content by means of the "Add Edlib Content" button.

<div class="text--center">
    <img class="edlib-image" alt="Edstep's 'Add Step' dialog with the 'Add Edlib Content' button" src="/img/edlib-workflow-2.png" />
    <br/>
    <em>Edstep's 'Add Step' dialog with the 'Add Edlib Content' button</em>
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

Clicking the "Add Edlib Content" button opens Edlib.

<div class="text--center">
    <img class="edlib-image" alt="Edlib's 'My Content' tab showing you a list of all your Edlib content" src="/img/edlib-workflow-3-1.png" />
    <br/>
    <em>Edlib's 'My Content' tab showing you a list of all your Edlib content</em>
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

Edlib's user interface is, broadly speaking, divided into three separate areas:
- My Content: This area (or tab) displays a list of all of the Edlib content that you have created together with the content that you are collaborating on with other people. 
- Shared Content: This tab displays all of the Edlib content that has been created and subsequently shared by other people and is available for re-use by the broader Edlib community. All content shared in this manner has an accompanying [Creative-Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/about/cclicenses).
- Authoring tools for H5P-based content: Edlib allows you to easily and quickly create a wide variety of over **40 types of web-based rich interactive content**.

The [reuse of existing Edlib content](/docs/product/userGuides/reusing-resources) is straightforward: find and select the appropriate content resource and either edit it or insert it directly into the accompanying course or game.

<div class="text--center">
    <img class="edlib-image" alt="Pre-viewing existing Edlib content" src="/img/edlib-workflow-3-2.png" />
    <br/>
    <em>Pre-viewing existing Edlib content</em>
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

If existing content &mdash;either yours or content that has been shared by other users with the wider Edlib community&mdash; is unsuitable, then your next course of action would be to create a new learning resource like, for example, an [interactive video](/docs/product/userGuides/creatingResources/interactive-video) &mdash; an HTML5-based interactive video content type allowing users to add multiple choice and fill in the blank questions, pop-up text and other types of interactions to their videos using only a web browser.

<div class="text--center">
    <img class="edlib-image" alt="H5P content type selector" src="/img/edlib-workflow-5.png" />
    <br/>
    <em>H5P content type selector</em>
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

As an example of creating an H5P-based learning resource, you can see in the screenshot below the H5P authoring environment for [H5P interactive videos](/docs/product/userGuides/creatingResources/interactive-video).

<div class="text--center">
    <img class="edlib-image" alt="H5P interactive video authoring environment" src="/img/edlib-workflow-6.png" />
    <br/>
    <em>H5P interactive video authoring environment</em>
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

Finally, after either selecting an existing resource for reuse or creating a new resource from scratch, the resource is made available inside of Edstep (or any other learning application that has been integrated with Edlib, for that matter).

<div class="text--center">
    <img class="edlib-image" alt="The Edlib resource in Edstep" src="/img/edlib-workflow-7.png" />
    <br/>
    <em>The Edlib resource in Edstep</em>
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

## Summary
The workflow we walked through above, can be summarised as follows:
1. Choose to add a learning resource to your course or learning game
2. After Edlib has opened, find and select an existing resource [to reuse](/docs/product/userGuides/reusing-resources)
3. Alternatively, if you cannot find a suitable existing resource to reuse, create a new resource
4. Choose which kind of interactive content you want to created from the drop-down list of H5P content types
5. Create your resource using the appropriate H5P authoring enviroment (dependent on which H5P content type you chose in Step 4)
6. Save (and insert) the resource after which it will be "embedded" into your learning application of choice
