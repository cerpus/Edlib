# Gamilab Teacher Guide
This quick start guide introduces Gamilab's features to those people that are using it in a teaching role.

## Course Setup
When creating a game, you can choose one of three game types:
1. [Explorer](#explorer)
2. [King of the Mountain](#king-of-the-mountain)
3. [Bike Race](#bike-race)

<div class="text--center">

    <br/>

Let's take a closer look at each one of the above game types in turn.

### Explorer
The original Gamilab learning model which is ideal for creating learning games that are content heavy. Start with an empty game board where you can add nodes which are connected by learning paths with custom requirements for opening new levels.

<div class="text--center">

Each node can contain various interactive elements such as basic text, videos, quizzes, flip cards and much more. You get to choose from over 40 different content types to create your game. Additionally, the built in question bank contains more than 30,000 questions and exercises that you can use.

### King of the Mountain
A simplified version of the Explore Mode with an added element of time. It is the ideal mode for creating quick quizzes where you can add questions from our question bank or create your own. The game has a set placement and numbers of nodes so all you need to do is add your questions and you’re ready to go. You can then easily share the game with your students and watch as they race to the top of the mountain, competing against time.

### Bike Race
The mode which brings all the elements of gaming and learning together in one place. Just like the King of the Mountain Mode, you get a set number of nodes and all you need to do is add in your questions. Share the game with your students and they’re off to the races. The Bike Race Mode requires the player not only to steer and navigate but to also answer the questions correctly to power up and get the best time.
