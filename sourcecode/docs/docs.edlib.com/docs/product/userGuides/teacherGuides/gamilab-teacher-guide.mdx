# Gamilab Teacher Guide
This quick start guide introduces Gamilab's features to those people that are using it in a teaching role.

## Game Setup
When creating a game, you can choose one of three game types:
1. [Explorer](#explorer)
2. [King of the Mountain](#king-of-the-mountain)
3. [Bike Race](#bike-race)

Let's take a closer look at each one of the above game types in turn.

### Explorer
The original Gamilab learning model which is ideal for creating learning games that are content heavy. Start with an empty game board where you can add nodes which are connected by learning paths with custom requirements for opening new levels.

Each node can contain various interactive elements such as basic text, videos, quizzes, flip cards and much more. You get to choose from over 40 different content types to create your game. Additionally, the built in [question bank](/docs/product/features#question-bank) contains more than 30,000 questions and exercises that you can use.

### King of the Mountain
A simplified version of the Explore Mode with an added element of time. It is the ideal mode for creating quick quizzes where you can add questions from our question bank or create your own. The game has a set placement and numbers of nodes so all you need to do is add your questions and you’re ready to go. You can then easily share the game with your students and watch as they race to the top of the mountain, competing against time.

### Bike Race
The mode which brings all the elements of gaming and learning together in one place. Just like the King of the Mountain Mode, you get a set number of nodes and all you need to do is add in your questions. Share the game with your students and they’re off to the races. The Bike Race Mode requires the player not only to steer and navigate but to also answer the questions correctly to power up and get the best time.

## Target Audience
To make it easier for other people to find your game on the [Gamilab website](https://gamilab.com/games) you can provide some additional information about the game's target audience including grade level, country and language.

## Collaborators
Building effective educational games can be a hard and time-consuming process. Being able to have multiple people collaborate is essential. Gamilab allows you to add other Gamilab users as collaborators by simply providing their email address. 

<div class="text--center">

## Game Board
Once you have configured your game and added the collaborators, you can move on to actually creating the game itself. The screenshot below shows an empty game board for an explorer-type game. From this point onwards you can start adding and positioning "nodes" together with &mdash;alternative&mdash; pathways between the nodes, on the board.
