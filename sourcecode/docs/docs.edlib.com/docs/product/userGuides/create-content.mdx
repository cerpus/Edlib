# Creating content

This guide will look at how to create new content in Edlib.

To start creating content, click the **Create content** button to the top left. Here you will have three options:

  - [Interactivity](#interactivity)
  - [Question](#question)
  - [Text](#text)

## Interactivity

Interactivity will probably be your most-used category. Here you will find all the supported [H5P's](https://docs.edlib.com/docs/product/features#h5p) in Edlib's catalog.

For a full list of all the H5P types and how to use them, check out H5P.org's [Examples and Downloads page](https://h5p.org/content-types-and-applications).
Edlib supports most of the H5P content types.
