## About Gamilab
[Gamilab](https://gamilab.com/) is an online platform where you can find and create fun and meaningful educational games. Gamilab uses game elements to motivate and engage players to learn faster and better, and to be more involved in their learning. By using elements like points, stars, highscores and badges Gamilab makes learning feel fun and motivates the player to learn while playing.
In addition to motivating students, Gamilab offers a complete package for teachers to use in their lessons. Teachers are free to add instructions, tasks or a mix of both into their games. This makes Gamilab especially suited for use in online learning.

## Different approaches for different needs
Gamilab currently supports two different game approaches; time-based games and score-based games. Today, the time-based games mainly use the QuestionBank for creating multiple-choice questions, but the creator can choose to create content using Edlib for the "King of the Mountain" game. 

The score-based game type "Explore" is probably where most users utilize Edlib, but they are free to choose between QuestionBank and Edlib here as well. However, using Edlib will make a large number of content types that Edlib provides available.

## How does Gamilab use Edlib?


All of the game modes in Gamilab has different nodes where questions or Edlib resources can be added. Through Gamilab’s game editor, the creator has full access to both searching for and creating Edlib resources. 


### Creating content

Currently, Edlib enpower the crator of games to create content the of the following kind
- Interactivity: H5Ps via the “H5P Hub”
- Question: a simplified question set generator with two persentation outputs:
    - Quiz (H5P)
    - Millionaire - a minigame based on “Who want’s to become a millionaire?”
- Text: a plain text document content type 

:::info 

Learn more about these three ways of creating content and see examples in our user guides section. [https://docs.edlib.com/docs/support/userGuides/create-content]

### H5P

Through the H5P Hub, the Gamilab user is able to make use of the chosen H5P types that is enabled for Gamilab. 

#### “Max score” - calculating and reporting the correct score to Gamilab

When a user has created an H5P task, Edlib calculates the total score, aka "Max score", and returns it to Gamilab. "Max score" is used in the gameplay to calculate how many percent correct players get on each task. Gamilab also translates the max score into its own score range, meaning that an H5P with a max score of 2 points will result in 200 points in Gamilab.The game creator can also choose to override any score at any time. If overridden, a resource can be edited and questions added without changing the set score on the node. The default score on a node is 100 points when detected to return score. Resources without score will have the score setting deactivated in Gamilab. The game creator can control the player's progression by setting the percentage needed to proceed - a setting that can be found on the paths between each node in "Explore" games. 



### Question
Question enables the user to create sets of multiple choice questions and finally choosing how these questions should be presented. 
Currently the user can choose between output in form of an H5P Quiz or as the “Who wants to become a millionaire?” minigame. 
In order to feed the questions into the two various presentation forms, the Question will go through the technical setup of the question set to verify that the correct amount of questions and answers are in place to convert it. If the set of questions has shortcomings, Edlib will prompt the user to adjust before proceeding is possible.

Example from a "Millionaire" minigame:
