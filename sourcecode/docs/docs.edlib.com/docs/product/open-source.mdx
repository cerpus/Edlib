# Open Source

Since the birth of Edlib back in 2015, we've worked steadily developing the product and trying to make the right decisions, and in 2021, we decided to do the right thing and turn it into an open-source project.

[The Edlib open-source project can be visited on GitHub by following this link.](https://github.com/cerpus/Edlib)

Since then, we've added and removed lots of code and tried to document it both here and on GitHub. Currently, we support contributions via GitHub and Weblate for translations. See the separate section about [how to contribute](https://docs.edlib.com/docs/developers/contributing/).

## How we work

Our primary focus derives from our roadmap and the genuine wish to develop the best application for creating and managing learning resources.  
We pick our tasks, one by one, closing up on the more or less moving target, and we stick to the plan. Everyone has a say, and we welcome any input from the community outside our organization.
