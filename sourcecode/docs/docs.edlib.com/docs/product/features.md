# Features

Edlib is continuously evolving with existing features being refined and other features being added (or removed). The following is a list of major features, several of which are in active development.

### Existing Features

* Support for all [H5P open-source content types](https://h5p.org/content-types-and-applications), some of which are highlighted below:
   * **Interactive video**: An interactive video content type allowing users to add multiple choice and fill in the blank questions, pop-up text and other types of interactions to their videos.
   * **Course presentation**: A presentation content type which allows users to add multiple choice questions, fill in the blanks, text, and other types of interactions to their presentations.
   * **Flash cards**: Interactive flashcards. Create a set of stylish and intuitive flashcards that have images paired with questions and answers. 
   * **Quiz**: A content type allowing creatives to create quizzes. Many question types are supported like multiple choice, fill-in-the-blanks, drag-the-words, mark-the-words and regular drag-and-drop.
* Content browser to easily find and re-use existing Edlib content. Content can be filtered by H5P content type, tags, [Creative-Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) license and so forth.
* Create content-by-URL: the ability to point to an existing (publicly available) resource and turn it into an Edlib-based learning resource.
* Licensing module with a Creative-Commons license selector.
* Authoring workflows including the ability to maintain resources private or to make them publicly available.
* Collaboration functionality.
* Easy integration with third-party APIs including audio, video and image APIs.
* The ability to create quizzes and game-based learning activities quickly and easily from the integrated question bank.
* [Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI)](https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/learning-tools-interoperability) version 1.0/1.2 provider and consumer support.
* Resource versioning. 
* Language support.

### Features in Development

* The &quot;Doku&quot; content type which allows for the bundling of multiple resources into a collection of resources and/or the further contextualisation of H5P-based resources with supplementary content &mdash;or instructions&mdash; effectively converting an interactive resource into a full-fledged **learning** resource. 
* The ability to include a recommendation engine to surface relevant content for course and game creators (currently in closed-beta).
