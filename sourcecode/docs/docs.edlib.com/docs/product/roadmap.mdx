As of **June 2021** we have defined Edlib's high-level roadmap to be the following:

1. Open source Edlib
    * Choose an [open-source license](https://github.com/cerpus/Edlib/blob/master/LICENSE)
    * Make the source code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/cerpus/Edlib)
    * Provide the initial [developer-focused documentation](https://github.com/cerpus/Edlib/issues/1)
2. Implement Edlib's new sharing features
    * Create and manage resource collections
    * Easily distribute both individual resources and resource collections together with relevant metadata inlcuding (but not limited to) learning goals, tags, descriptions, education level and so forth
    * The ability to connect Edlib resources to national curricula standards, starting with Norway's national standard, [UDIR](https://www.udir.no/laring-og-trivsel/lareplanverket/)
    * Share content privately, publicly or in groups 
3. Implement Edlib's new question bank feature
4. Finalise the new &quot;Doku&quot; feature
5. Finalise Edlib's recommendation engine and accompanying API

In addition to the above goals or milestones, we are continuously looking at ways to improve Edlib from both a performance and a user-experience point of view. What's more, the roadmap could change based on feedback from the [community](/docs/community/contributing).
