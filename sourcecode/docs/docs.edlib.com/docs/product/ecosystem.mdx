# Ecosystem

Edlib is very much a part of a larger ecosystem that includes &mdash;but, is not limited to&mdash; open educational resources, [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) licensing and [H5P](https://h5p.org/).

## Open Educational Resources
[Open educational resources (OERs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources) are any type of educational material that is in the public domain. They are published under open licenses (for example, Creative Commons licenses) that specify how materials can be used, reused, adapted, shared and modified according to specific needs, all within the boundaries of copyright law. OERs can include textbooks, lecture notes, syllabi, assignments and tests.

### OER Benefits
For teaching staff, OERs can supplement and add value to existing curriculum resources. At the same time, OERs can reduce the cost of education for students (reducing financial stress by removing textbook purchases).

For students, using OERs can expose students to a wider range of digital learning opportunities in the form of open texts, open images, open courseware, and self-assessment tools. In general, learners can benefit from:

- Enhanced quality and flexibility of resources.
- Seeing/applying knowledge in a wider context than their course may otherwise allow (for example, an international dimension).
- Support for learner-centered, self-directed, peer-to-peer and social/informal learning approaches.

## Creative Commons Licensing
Creative Commons licensing addresses the following use cases:

- **Reuse**: Content can be reused in its unaltered original format.
- **Retain**: Copies of content can be retained for personal archives or reference.
- **Revise**: Content can be modified or altered to suit specific needs.
- **Remix**: Content can be adapted with other similar content to create something new.
- **Redistribute**: Content can be shared with anyone else in its original or altered format.

Creative Commons licensing plays a critical role within the context of open educational resources.

## H5P
A more in-depth overview of the Edlib ecosystem &mdash;including H5P&mdash; is currently being worked on. Check back for updates.
