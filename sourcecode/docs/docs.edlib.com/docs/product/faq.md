# Frequently Asked Questions

<p class="edlib-question">1. What is Edlib and how does it work?</p>
<br/>
<br/>

Edlib is an [open-source](https://github.com/cerpus/Edlib) platform for creating, sharing, storing and using rich interactive learning resources in the cloud. Edlib allows anyone to create highly interactive [H5P](https://h5p.org/content-types-and-applications)-based learning resources. The H5P platform provides a large collection of interactive and rich content types for the purpose of learning. 

Experience &mdash;together with research&mdash; shows that an increased level of meaningful **interactions** leads to a higher level of **engagement** which, in turn, leads to increased **motiviation** ultimately resulting in a more positive **learning outcome** for the learner.

Answer

<p class="edlib-question">4. Is Edlib free?</p>
<br/>
<br/>

Edlib is an GPL 3.0-licensed [open-source project](https://github.com/cerpus/Edlib), meaning that you can fork and clone the project, build it, deploy it and subsequently host it for yourself without us charging you anything to do so. We really hope that with the help of this documentation you can do exactly that. Alternatively, you could also get in touch with us to [help you out](/docs/solutions/custom-development) with getting Edlib up and running. We would genuinely be happy to help. 

<p class="edlib-question">5. How do I start using Edlib?</p>
<br/>
<br/>

First of all, you'll need to fork and clone the [Edlib GitHub repository](https://github.com/cerpus/Edlib). Edlib follows the so-called [monorepo development strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) meaning that it contains everything (from a source-code point of view) to get up and running.
