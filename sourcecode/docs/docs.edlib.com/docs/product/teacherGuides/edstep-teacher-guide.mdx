# Edstep Teacher Guide

In [Edstep](https://edstep.com), a teacher has responsibility for the materials in their own course. They often also manage enrolments and are able to customize the course page. This quick start guide introduces Edstep's features to those people that are using Edstep in a teaching role.

## Course Setup

Setting up a course in Edstep requires the user to go through a series of steps the first of which is to provide the name of the course and any &mdash;optional&mdash; tags. After having provided the before-mentioned information, the course is created followed by providing additional information to make it easier for learners to find your course in the Edstep marketing place. 

<div class="text--center">
    <img class="edlib-image" alt="Setting up a course in Edstep" src="/img/edstep-about.png" />
    <br/>

</div>

After having provided the information described about you can start focusing on adding collaborators and defining the learning goals.

Let's take a look at each of the above-mentioned steps in turn.

### Collaborators

Adding collaborators &mdash;or co-authors as they are called&mdash; to your course is as easy as providing their email address and clicking on the "+" button. The email has to be the same one they used to sign up to Edstep.

<div class="text--center">
    <img class="edlib-image" alt="Adding collaborators to a course" src="/img/edstep-collaboration.png" />
    <br/>
    <em>Adding collaborators to a course</em>
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

In addition to adding collaborators to your course, you can also transfer the ownership of the course to a collaborator by clicking on the "Author" option in list of collaborators. Only course owners can publish a course.

### Learning goals

Edstep allows you create an overall goal for your course. In addition to the main course goal you can also define sub-goals for each module (Edstep courses consist of modules and accompanying learning activities or "steps"). 

<div class="text--center">
    <img class="edlib-image" alt="Adding course goals" src="/img/edstep-goals.png" />
    <br/>
    <em>Adding course goals</em>
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

Both the course's main goal and module goals are prominently displayed to learners as they progress through the course.

## Course Content
After having worked throught the steps mentioned above, you can start focusing on the content of your course, a process which has been described as part of the [Edlib Workflow](/docs/product/userGuides/edlib-workflow).

<div class="text--center">
    <img class="edlib-image" alt="Managing course content" src="/img/edstep-content.png" />
    <br/>
    <em>Managing course content</em>
</div>

## Publishing
Edstep has sophisticated publishing features which allow you to not only choose a specific audience for your course but also, in turn, configure exactly how the course should be presented to the audience. Contrary to other course platforms, Edstep allows you to make your course available to three distinct audiences:
1. Learners
2. Instructors
3. Course designers 

In this guide, we'll limit ourselves to looking at the first audience: learners (tutorials for making your course available to instructors and course designers will be added at a later date).
