## Game Setup
When creating a game, you can choose one of three game types:
1. [Explore](#explore)
2. [King of the Mountain](#king-of-the-mountain)
3. [Bike Race](#bike-race)

<div class="text--center">
    <img class="edlib-image" alt="Gamilab's game types" src="/img/gamilab-game-types.png" />
    <br/>
    <em>Gamilab's game types</em>
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

Let's take a closer look at each one of the above game types in turn.

### Explore
The original Gamilab learning model which is ideal for creating learning games that are content heavy. Start with an empty game board where you can add nodes which are connected by learning paths with custom requirements for opening new levels.

<div class="text--center">
    <img class="edlib-image" alt="An explore game in Gamilab" src="/img/gamilab-explorer-game.png" />
    <br/>

    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

Each node can contain various interactive elements such as basic text, videos, quizzes, flip cards and much more. You get to choose from over 40 different content types to create your game. Additionally, the built in [question bank](/docs/product/features#question-bank) contains more than 30,000 questions and exercises that you can use.

### King of the Mountain
A simplified version of the Explore Mode with an added element of time. It is the ideal mode for creating quick quizzes where you can add questions from our question bank or create your own. The game has a set placement and numbers of nodes so all you need to do is add your questions and you’re ready to go. You can then easily share the game with your students and watch as they race to the top of the mountain, competing against time.

<div class="text--center">

    <br/>

    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>


### Bike Race
The mode which brings all the elements of gaming and learning together in one place. Just like the King of the Mountain Mode, you get a set number of nodes and all you need to do is add in your questions. Share the game with your students and they’re off to the races. The Bike Race Mode requires the player not only to steer and navigate but to also answer the questions correctly to power up and get the best time.

## Target Audience
To make it easier for other people to find your game on the [Gamilab website](https://gamilab.com/games) you can provide some additional information about the game's target audience:
- Grade level
- Country
- Language

<div class="text--center">
    <img class="edlib-image" alt="Managing your game's target audience" src="/img/gamilab-target-audience.png" />
    <br/>
    <em>Managing your game's target audience</em>
</div>

## Collaborators
Building effective educational games can be a hard and time-consuming process. Being able to have multiple people collaborate is essential. Gamilab allows you to add other Gamilab users as collaborators by simply providing their email address. 

<div class="text--center">
    <img class="edlib-image" alt="Managing collaborators for your game" src="/img/gamilab-collaborators.png" />
    <br/>
    <em>Managing your collaborators for your game</em>
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

:::caution
Make sure you are providing the correct email address when adding a person as a collaborator. The email address has to be the same email address that they used to sign up with to Gamilab. Gamilab, for security and privacy purposes, does not provide autocompletion on email addresses of its users. 
:::

## Game Board
Once you have configured your game and added the collaborators, you can move on to actually creating the game itself. The screenshot below shows an empty game board for an explorer-type game. From this point onwards you can start building your game by either double-clicking on the canvas to bring up the content menu or, alternatively, clicking on the Get Started button on the game board. 

<div class="text--center">
    <img class="edlib-image" alt="Gamilab's game board" src="/img/gamilab-game-board.png" />
    <br/>
    <em>Gamilab's game board</em>
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

If you click the Getting Started button a dialog window is displayed allowing you to choose your background image from different themes together with the number of nodes you want Gamilab to automatically create for you followed by the option to either create in-game questions (and answers) or to search in Gamilab's Question bank for existing questions and answers that you can (re)use in your game.

If, however, you prefer to add your own activities to the game then double-clicking on the canvas will display the content menu which allows you to add existing H5P-based interactive content from Edlib or create new content.

<div class="text--center">
    <img class="edlib-image" alt="Gamilab's content menu" src="/img/gamilab-game-content-menu.png" />
    <br/>
    <em>Gamilab's content menu</em>
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

Choosing "Add node with content" will open up Edlib providing you with the option to either find and reuse existing Edlib content or create new Edlib content. How to use Edlib is described in the [Edlib Workflow](/docs/product/userGuides/edlib-workflow) guide.

## High Score Settings
Gamilab allows you to display a high-score list for your game. High-score lists can be highly motivating for certain students. 

<div class="text--center">
    <img class="edlib-image" alt="Gamilab's high-score settings" src="/img/gamilab-highscore-settings.png" />
    <br/>
    <em>Gamilab's high-score settings</em>
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

You can configure how many players should appear in the high-score list together with how many player must complete the game before displaying the high-score list. Finally, to avoid a demotivating effect on players you can also configure that players with low scores are not displayed at the bottom end of the list.

## Publish Settings
Once you have finished building your game you can publish the game effectively making it accessible to other players. Before publishing your game, you can preview it &mdash;and even play it&mdash; by clicking on the Preview button located at the top of the menu (but, below your game's thumbnail image and name). The status of the game will change from Unpublished to Published (visible in the top, left-hand corner).

<div class="text--center">
    <img class="edlib-image" alt="Gamilab's publish settings" src="/img/gamilab-publish-settings.png" />
    <br/>
    <em>Gamilab's publish settings</em>
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

:::caution
If you don't publish your game it will not be accessible to your students. So, don't forget to hit that publish button :wink:
:::

Currently, when publishing a game you can cofigure it to be possible for other people to copy your game for the purpose of reuse. Furthermore, you can configure the game to require that players log in to play (by default, players do not need to sign up and log in to Gamilab to play) and if the game should appear in the [Gamilab marketplace](https://gamilab.com/games).

It is also possible to unpublish a game effectively making it inaccessible to players. There are no limits as to how many times you can publish or unpublish a game.

## Play Codes
By default, Gamilab will create a "play code" for your game. Play codes serve multiple purposes. First of all, you can distribute a game and provide your students with a short, six-character (play) code to access and play the game instead of having to use a long cryptic link. All the student has to do is go to Gamilab's [Play code page](https://gamilab.com/play) and paste in the code you provided them followed by clicking on the Play button. It's that simple :wink:

<div class="text--center">
    <img class="edlib-image" alt="Play codes in Gamilab" src="/img/gamilab-playcodes.png" />
    <br/>
    <em>Play codes in Gamilab</em>
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

Another advantage of using play codes is that they allow you to divide a large(r) group of students into smaller ones by creating multiple play codes and distributing the play codes to different groups of players. This way, each group (by means of the accompanying play code) will have its own high-score list and results &mdash; the latter of which we will take look at in the next section: [Results and Tracking Progress](#results-and-tracking-progress).

## Results and Tracking Progress
Gamilab is a game-based educational platform. This means that as a teacher, you need to be able to see how your students are progressing. 

<div class="text--center">
    <img class="edlib-image" alt="Tracking your students' progress" src="/img/gamilab-results.png" />
    <br/>
    <em>Tracking your students' progress</em>
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

As mentioned, Gamilab groups a game's results by play code allowing you, the teacher, to see how results for the group as a whole (average result, top-5 players, bottom-5 players and so forth) as well as being able to drill-down and see how how individual students have performed. For example, you will be able to see how many attempts a student made on a specific task and the accompanying points they obtained.
