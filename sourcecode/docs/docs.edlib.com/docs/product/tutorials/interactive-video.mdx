# H5P Interactive Video

Here's the Interactive video we'll create in this tutorial:

<iframe
  class="edlib-iframe"
  title="H5P Interactive video: Develop simple mobile games"
  width="800"
  height="500"
  src="https://www.edlib.com/s/resources/50e41e41-d065-491e-8f5b-9f3c4a1478d2"
/>
<div class="text--center">
    <em>H5P Interactive video: Develop simple mobile games</em>
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

The Interactive video content type allows you to add interactions on top of video clips. Interactions such as images, elaborating text, links and quizzes pop up while the learner watches the video.

You can watch and interact with the above H5P Interactive video.

## When To Use Interactive Videos
Interactive videos are perfect when you already have a video clip that you want to enrich with interactive elements.

You can facilitate differentiated learning by adding in-depth information such as pictures, tables, text and links that the learner can interact with during video playback. Include puzzles for the learners to solve at any given time in the video by adding Multichoice questions, Fill in the blanks, Drag and drop questions and Summaries.

## Step 1: Topic
We'll use a video &mdash;from Matthew Palaje, a well-known indipendent game developer&mdash; on mobile game developments as a basis for this tutorial.

## Step 2: Video Files
A video clip is the cornerstone of any interactive video. 

:::caution
The [MPEG-4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-4) video format will work in most browsers. However, you should provide an alternative video in [WebM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebM) format just to be sure. 
:::

You can check which browsers support the MPEG-4 video format over at [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/mpeg4). In order to convert the MPEG-4 video to a WebM format, you can use an open-source converter such as [Miro](http://www.mirovideoconverter.com/). 

## Step 3: Creating an Interactive Video
Select the New content option and choose Interactive video from the list of content types:

<div class="text--center">
    <img class="edlib-image" alt="H5P content type selector" src="/img/course-presentation1.png" />
    <br/>
    <em>Image: H5P content type selector</em>
</div>

## Step 4: Interactive Video Editor
The Interactive video editor should now appear. The top part of the editor looks like this:

<div class="text--center">
    <img class="edlib-image" alt="Blank H5P Interactive video editor" src="/img/interactive-video1.png" />
    <br/>
    <em>Image: Blank H5P Interactive video editor</em>
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

In this tutorial, we'll focus on creating the interactive elements in the video. Therefore, we'll focus on the top part of the editor, above the Common fields header.

The Interactive video content type consists of three tabs: 
1. Upload video
2. Add interactions
3. Summary task

These three steps represent a natural workflow for creating an Interactive video. By default, the Upload video tab is displayed when you create a new Interactive video, and this is what you always want to start off with.

## Step 5: Upload Video
Here's where we add the video clips that our Interactive video is based on. Press the "+" button and then press the "Upload video file" button or simply paste the link to a publicly available &mdash;and appropriately licensed&mdash; video:

<div class="text--center">
    <img class="edlib-image" alt="Adding a video file, video source URL or YouTube link" src="/img/interactive-video2.png" />
    <br/>
    <em>Image: Adding a video file, video source URL or YouTube link</em>
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

If you chose to upload a video file then browse to where you downloaded the MPEG-4 video file from step 1 and upload the video:

<div class="text--center">
    <img class="edlib-image" alt="Alternative video qualities" src="/img/interactive-video3.png" />
    <br/>
    <em>Image: Alternative video qualities</em>
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

Press the plus button again to add an alternative video format in WebM format to ensure support in all browsers. 

## Step 6: Add Interactions
Press the Add interactions tab in the top of the editor. The video clip we added in the previous step is previewed:

<div class="text--center">
    <img class="edlib-image" alt="Video preview" src="/img/interactive-video4.png" />
    <br/>
    <em>Image: Video preview</em>
</div>

We use the toolbar above the video clip to add interactions:

<div class="text--center">
    <img class="edlib-image" alt="Interactive video toolsbar" src="/img/interactive-video5.png" />
    <br/>
    <em>Image: Interactive video toolsbar</em>
</div>

There are three different types of interactions:

1. Quiz interaction (Question), presented as a blue button
2. Simple interactions (Text, Image, Table), presented as a purple button and
3. Adaptivity (Go To) interaction

In this tutorial, we'll add a Text and an Image interaction.
