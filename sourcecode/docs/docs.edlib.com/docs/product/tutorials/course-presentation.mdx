Here's the Course presentation we'll create in this tutorial:

## When to use Course presentations
Course presentation enables you to author and deliver your course material directly in your browser. Course presentations contain slides where you can add various multimedia and interactive elements to engage the learner.

Course presentations are used when you want to package a piece of learning content in a structured and interactive format. Learners swipe through slides to experience the learning material while solving various quizzes or watching videos along the way.  

Try Course presentations as an alternative to presenting your learning content as Powerpoint presentations, PDFs or text-based web pages. Course presentations are very flexible to use, as they are simple to create, publish and edit.

### Step 1: Topic
We'll choose video games as the topic for our Course presentation. We'll use the Wikipedia article about the [history of video games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_video_games) as background material for our Course presentation.

Let's create three slides, with a test at the end:

- Slide 1: Brief history of computer games
- Slide 2: 2D games
- Slide 3: 3D games
- Summary

### Step 2: Creating a Course presentation
Select the New content option and choose Course presentation from the list of content types:

<div class="text--center">
    <img class="edlib-image" alt="Pending" src="/img/course-presentation1.png" />
    <br/>
    <em>Image: Pending</em>
</div>

### Step 3: Course presentation editor
The Course presentation editor should now appear. When starting to edit a Course presentation the editor looks like this:

<div class="text--center">
    <img class="edlib-image" alt="Pending" src="/img/course-presentation2.png" />
    <br/>
    <em>Image: Pending</em>
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

In this tutorial, we'll focus on creating the Course presentation content. The content creation happens in the top part of the editor, so we'll only focus on this for now.

The Course presentation editor is WYSIWYG. The end-user view of the Course presentation will look very similar to the editor's view.

### Step 4: Slide 1
We'll start by adding a slide in the slides panel to the left. The slide titles can be used to navigate between the slides. You can remove the slides panel entirely by pressing the Remove slides button. However, this action cannot be undone.

Press the  button to open the "Slides" menu. Press the pen next to "No title"  to add a slide title. Use "History of Computer Games" as the title. You should now have something like this: 

<div class="text--center">
    <img class="edlib-image" alt="Pending" src="/img/course-presentation3.png" />
    <br/>
    <em>Image: Pending</em>
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

Now we can move on to adding some images. 

We add the pictures by using the  button in the top toolbar. Press this button, drag it to where you want the image to be placed and drop it there. A dialog will automatically open:

<div class="text--center">
    <img class="edlib-image" alt="Pending" src="/img/course-presentation4.png" />
    <br/>
    <em>Image: Pending</em>
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

Press the  button, browse to where you saved the cloudberry flower picture and select it for upload.

You should now have something like this: 

<div class="text--center">
    <img class="edlib-image" alt="Pending" src="/img/course-presentation5.png" />
    <br/>
    <em>Image: Pending</em>
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

Resize the picture by pulling in the lower right corner of the image. Make the image slightly smaller in size. You can move the picture by using drag and drop. Place it in the top left corner.

Now, add a second picture. This time, we'll use the cloudberry picture and place it beneath the cloudberry flower picture. Use the same procedure as above. 

To finish slide 1, we'll add the following text, which is paraphrased from the Wikipedia article:

The Rubus chamaemorus is a herb producing amber-colored edible fruit similar to the raspberry or blackberry.
The cloudberry grows to 10â€“25 cm high. The leaves alternate between having 5 and 7 soft, handlike lobes on straight, branchless stalks. After pollination, the white flowers form raspberry-sized berries.
Each fruit is initially pale red, ripening into an amber color in early autumn. Use the Text tool  to add a block of text to the slide. Once you have dropped the text box, a dialog will appear. Insert the text above in the Edit text dialog.

We have now finished slide 1. 

### Step 5: Slide 2
Press the  button in the lower right corner of the editor to add another slide. 

Slide 2 will contain information about where Cloudberries can be found. Add the slide title Where to find them? in the slides panel. 

We'll use the map picture from Wikipedia to show where Cloudberries grow in the wild. We add the picture by using the  button in the top toolbar. Drag the picture onto the slide, upload the picture and add license information. Press Done, then resize the picture so you have something like this:

<div class="text--center">
    <img class="edlib-image" alt="Pending" src="/img/course-presentation6.png" />
    <br/>
    <em>Image: Pending</em>
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

To finish slide 2, we'll add the following text, which is also paraphrased from the Wikipedia article:

Cloudberries are found in mountainous areas on the Northern Hemisphere

Europe: In the Nordic countries and the Baltic states
Asia: Across northern Russia east towards the Pacific Ocean
North America: across most of northern Canada, Alaska, northern Minnesota, New Hampshire and Maine
As on slide 1, use the Text tool  to add a text box to the slide. Once you have dropped the text box, a dialog will appear. Insert the text above in the Edit text dialog:

You can navigate between slides by pressing the slide titles in the slides panel or by using the navigation bar. 

### Step 6: Slide 3
Press the  button to add the third slide. Slide 3 will describe various uses of the cloudberry. Add the slide title Uses in the slides panel. 

Again, we'll use text and images to deliver our message. In addition, we'll add a link to a website where the learner can find recipes using cloudberries. 

Here are the links to the Wikimedia Commons pictures we'll use:

finnish cheese with cloudberry jam
spoon of cloudberry jam
oatmeal with cloudberries
We add the pictures by using the  button in the top toolbar. As on slide 1, we'll place the pictures in a column on the left side of the slide. Insert the three pictures, add the appropriate license information, place and resize them so you have something like this:

**Screenshot**

The text we'll use, is again paraphrased from the Wikipedia article:

In Finland, the berries are eaten with heated, local cheese
In Sweden, cloudberry jam is used as a topping for ice cream, pancakes, and waffles
In Norway, they are often mixed with whipped cream and sugar
In Atlantic Canada, cloudberries are used to make "Bakeapple Pie".
In Alaska and Northern Canada, the berries are mixed with seal oil, reindeer or caribou fat, and sugar to make "Eskimo Ice Cream" or "Akutaq".
Use the Text tool  to add a block of text to the slide. Once you have dropped the text box, a dialog will appear. Insert the text above in the Edit text dialog. Press Done when you're finished. You should now have something like this:

**Screenshot**

Finally, we'll add a link. Use the  button on the toolbar and place the link onto the slide. 

We can find a selection of Cloudberry desserts on yummly.com. Here's the URL: http://www.yummly.com/recipes/cloudberry-dessert

Use the link text Cloudberry dessert recipes.

Press Done. then resize and place the link box so you have something like this:

**Screenshot**

We're now finished with slide 3. Finally, we'll add a Summary to finish the Course presentation.

### Step 7: Slide 4
Press the  button to add a fourth and final slide. Add the slide title Summary in the slides panel. 

The Summary will allow the learner to make an interactive summary of the most important aspects of the previous three slides.

On the toolbar, press the  button and drag a summary onto the slide. Creating a Summary is covered in this tutorial. 

Once you have dropped the Summary, the editor will appear. 

Now we'll add statements to the Summary. Press the Add statements button to add two more statement groups.

In the Summary editor, the top statement in a statement group is always the correct one. 

Introduction text:

Choose the correct statement about Cloudberries.

Statement group 1: 

Cloudberries are similar in shape and size to raspberries and blackberries.
Cloudberries are similar in shape and size to blueberries and redcurrants.
Cloudberries are similar in shape and size to strawberries.
Statement group 2:

Cloudberries are found in the Northern Hemisphere.
Cloudberries are found in the Southern Hemisphere.
Statement group 3:

In Atlantic Canada, cloudberries are often used to make "Bakeapple pie".
In Atlantic Canada, cloudberries are mainly eaten with a heated local cheese.
In Atlantic Canada, cloudberries are mainly eaten with a heated local cheese.
Press Done when you have added the statements. Then position and resize the Summary so you'll have something like this:

### Step 8: Finishing up
At the bottom of the editor, you'll find the Enable show solution buttons option. In this context, the option does not have any effect.
