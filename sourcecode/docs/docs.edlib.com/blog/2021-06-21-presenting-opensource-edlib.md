It's a proud moment for the [Cerpus](https://cerpus.com/) Edlib team to finally be able to present Edlib as not only a "hub" for open educational resources but also as a complete [open-source project](https://github.com/cerpus/Edlib). We are thrilled to show the world some of the things we have been working on for the last 6 years.

As the main authoring platform for [Gamilab](https://gamilab.com/) and [Edstep](https://edstep.com/), Edlib is really the fundamental backbone of educational content management and has given birth to thousands of new educational resources. 

Even if Edlib in its current form is only a mature six-year-old, the seed was planted more than a decade ago and carefully nurtured and shaped into what it is today by *Tommy W. Nordeng* who will forever be its spiritual progenitor.

In addition to Tommy's vision, Edlib has been developed in close collaboration with NDLA, the *Norwegian Digital Learning Arena*, who has both inspired us and contributed in the form of tireless feedback and numerous feature requests all of which were required to create truly engaging [H5P](https://h5p.org/)-based content for their award-winning open educational resources platform, [NDLA.no](https://ndla.no/en/).

Although a lot more needs to be done with regards to open-sourcing Edlib, the work has started and so has our journey on an even more inspiring path: to become one of the leading educational open source companies in Norway and beyond. 

&mdash; Tor-Martin and The Edlib team
