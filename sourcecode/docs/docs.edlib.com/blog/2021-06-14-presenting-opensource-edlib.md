It's a real joy for Cerpus to finally be able to present Edlib as not only an Open Content "hub" but also as a complete open-source project. We are thrilled to show the world some of the things we have been working on for the last five years.

Even if Edlib in its current form is only a mature five year old, the seed was planted over ten years ago and carefully nurtured and shaped into what it is today by *Tommy W. Nordeng* who will forever be its spiritual progenitor.

In addition to Tommy's vision, Edlib has been developed in close collaboration with NDLA who has both inspired us and requested features which were needed for their award winning open educational resources platform, [NDLA.no](https://ndla.no/en/).

Although a lot more needs to be done with regards to open-sourcing Edlib, the work has started and so has our journey on an even more inspiring path &mdash; to become one of the leading educational open source companies in Norway and beyond.
