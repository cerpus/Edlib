# Edlib 


Edlib is an [open-source](https://github.com/cerpus/Edlib/blob/master/LICENSE) application for creating, sharing, storing, and using rich interactive learning resources.

* Integrate Edlib to your frontend CMS or LMS system to enhance efficiency through reuse and collaboration on learning content for your system users. 
* Insert content into a context within your learning system or point directly to the specific content using links. 
* All resources are stored and available through a single repository for your learning content - neat and tidy.

> The individual learner is at the center of everything we do, and our vision is to provide first-class open learning tools and content to as many of those individuals as possible. &mdash; Tommy W. Nordeng (co-founder of Edlib AS)
