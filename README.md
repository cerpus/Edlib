# Edlib

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/github/cerpus/Edlib/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=E3ZWIO0XR8)](https://codecov.io/github/cerpus/Edlib)

Edlib is an [open-source](https://github.com/cerpus/Edlib/blob/master/LICENSE) application for creating, sharing, storing, and using rich interactive learning resources.
As a functional resource hub created for integration towards your frontend CMS or LMS system, Edlib seeks to enhance efficiency through reuse and collaboration on learning content for your system users. You can insert the content into a context within your learning system or point directly to the specific content using links. All resources are stored and available through Edlib, which means no files to keep track of and a single repository for your learning content - neat and tidy.

> The individual learner is at the center of everything we do, and our vision is to provide first-class open learning tools and content to as many of those individuals as possible. &mdash; Tommy W. Nordeng (co-founder of Cerpus)

We strongly believe that the focus should be on the individual learner. Everything we do is based on this belief, from technical solutions and content creation to user interface design and the resulting learning experience.  

Edlib is being developed with :heart: by [Cerpus](https://cerpus.com/), a company based out of Northern Norway focused on developing innovative educational services and applications. Edlib was specifically designed to allow for the creation and subsequent management of [H5P](https://h5p.org/)-based interactive learning resources for Cerpus's applications &mdash; [Gamilab](https://gamilab.com/) and the former Edstep platform &mdash; as well as being easily capable of integration into third-party learning applications.

## Why Edlib? 

Edlib allows you to create highly interactive H5P-based learning resources. The H5P platform provides a wealth of different interactive and rich content types for learning purposes. We believe that an increased level of meaningful **interactions** leads to a higher level of **engagement**. A higher level of engagement, in turn, leads to increased **motivation** ultimately resulting in a more positive **learning outcome** for the learner.

The internet is a vast collection of self-contained content repositories like Wikipedia and YouTube with many purpose-built tools to create rich interactive content. So, the question becomes: *How can we combine the vast trove of existing, high-quality content with the necessary creation tools to ensure a superior learning experience for the individual learner?* We think that, at least, a part of the answer to that question is to make the threshold for acquiring external content as low as possible. In Edlib, for example, a YouTube video can be converted into an Edlib resource by just providing its URL. From that point onwards, it will be included in the Edlib content repository just like any other Edlib resource, ready for reuse.

## Feature Support

Edlib is continuously evolving, with existing features being refined and new features being added. The following is a list of major features, several of which are in active development.

### Existing Features

* Support for all [H5P open-source content types](https://h5p.org/content-types-and-applications), some of which are highlighted below:
   * **Interactive video**: An interactive video content type that allows users to add multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank questions, pop-up text, and other interactions to their videos.
   * **Course presentation**: A presentation content type that allows users to add multiple choice questions, fill in the blanks, text, and other interactions to their presentations.
   * **Flashcards**: Interactive flashcards. Create a set of stylish and intuitive flashcards that have images paired with questions and answers. 
   * **Quiz**: A content type allowing creatives to create quizzes. Many question types are supported like multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blanks, drag-the-words, mark-the-words, and regular drag-and-drop.
* Content explorer to easily find and re-use existing Edlib content. Content can be filtered by H5P content type, tags, [Creative-Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) license, and so forth.
* Licensing module with an intelligent Creative-Commons license selector.
* Authoring workflows, including maintaining resources private or making them publicly available.
* Collaboration functionality for content creators.
* Easy integration with third-party APIs, including audio, video, and image APIs.
* The ability to create quizzes and game-based learning activities quickly and easily from the integrated question bank.
* [Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI)](https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/learning-tools-interoperability) version 1.0/1.2 provider and consumer support.
* Resource versioning. 
* The ability to create language variants of the same underlying resource easily and quickly.

### Features in Development

* The &quot;Doku&quot; content type allows for the bundling of multiple resources into a collection of resources and/or the further contextualization of H5P-based resources with supplementary content, or instructions, effectively converting an interactive resource into a full-fledged **learning** resource. 
* The ability to include a recommendation engine to surface relevant content for course and game creators (currently in closed beta).
* The Question Bank service to assist with the auto-generation of, for example, [H5P Question Sets](https://h5p.org/question-set) or educational games

## Miscellaneous

### Code coverage status

The code coverage report is currently covering the PHP parts of the Edlib code for the following parts of Edlib:

- Content Author: [![codecov](https://codecov.io/github/cerpus/Edlib/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=E3ZWIO0XR8)](https://codecov.io/github/cerpus/Edlib)

- WWW: N/A - currently not available as this part of Edlib is being rewritten. Check back later for updates on this.

### Metadata

Edlib includes the ability to record metadata on learning objects. Setting the metadata can be done directly on the object itself or indirectly via transitive relations. Setting contextual metadata on learning objects is a means to an end, not an end in itself; that is, contextual metadata is about **findability** of content for both creators and learners.
